# Intrusion-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

Dataset used: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids.html

The UNB ISCX IDS 2012 dataset consists of labeled network traces, including full packet payloads in pcap format. The ISCX-IDS-2012 intrusion detection evaluation dataset consists of 7 days of network activity (normal and malicious).

This project presented an approach for dealing with the class-imbalance problem that consisted of combining different expressions of re-sampling-based classifiers in an informed fashion. In particular, our system was built so as to bias the classifiers towards the positive set in order to counteract the negative bias typically developed by classifiers facing a higher proportion of negative than positive examples. The positive bias we included was carefully regulated by an elimination strategy designed to prevent unreliable attributes to participate in the process. The technique was shown to be effective on ISCX IDS 2012 dataset as compared to a single classifier or another general-purpose method like Decision Trees.
